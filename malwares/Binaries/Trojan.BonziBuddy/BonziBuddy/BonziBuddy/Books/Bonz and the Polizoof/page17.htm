<p ALIGN="center"></font><font size="3">Mari Robeson is an Art &amp; Design graduate from
Cal Poly State University, San Luis Obispo, CA. After graduating she worked in corporate
advertising for over ten years.</p>

<p ALIGN="center">With the birth of her first daughter in 1995 her dream to write and
illustrate began to unfold when she opened Le Sol Design Studio. Within three months she
had illustrated her first children's book and started her greetings and gifts company.
Shortly after, she was illustrating for national greeting card companies as well as
designing for several businesses.</p>

<p ALIGN="center">In 1998 her New Mother's Journal, Magical Moments was published which is
filled with her original illustrations and parenting ideas.</p>

<p ALIGN="center">Recently Mari has hooked up with BONZI Software to write and illustrate
the adventuresome stories of BONZ, the fun loving gorilla who always is up to something
new and exciting.</p>
